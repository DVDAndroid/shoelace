Shoelace is an alternative frontend for Instagram's [Threads](https://threads.net/). It delivers a lightweight, minimalist, and privacy-friendly alternative to Threads' web UI, and requires no browser-side JavaScript to access.

Shoelace is co-developed and powered by [spools](https://git.sr.ht/~nixgoat/spools), a content scraping library for Threads, written in Rust.
